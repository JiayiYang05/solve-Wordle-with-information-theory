Reflecting on my initial project plan, I can see that while the core strategy was solid, several key aspects needed more careful consideration. My thinking has evolved in a few areas:

## Pattern Representation: 
I hadn't fully specified how to manage the color patterns. I needed to decide on an efficient system, ultimately choosing between string-based representations (like "GGYXY") or a more performant numerical encoding.

## Computational Efficiency: 
I was rightly concerned about the O(nÂ²) complexity. I knew I had to plan for optimizations from the start, such as:

- Caching previously computed pattern results to avoid redundant calculations.

- Leveraging NumPy for vectorized operations to speed up the core logic.

- Having a fallback to sampling methods if the full word lists proved too slow to process entirely.

## Initial Guess: 
I recognized that precomputing the best starting word was a necessary step. Since it's a one-time, expensive calculation, it made perfect sense to cache and reuse it.

## Non-uniform Distribution: 
My plan for two versions (uniform vs. frequency-based) was a good start. However, I realized the frequency version would only be meaningful if I integrated a proper language model or a robust word frequency corpus, which became a separate research task.

## Fallback Strategy: 
I learned that a brute-force entropy approach isn't always optimal. I implemented a simple but effective rule: when only a few words remain, it's faster and more efficient to switch to guessing directly from the remaining list.
